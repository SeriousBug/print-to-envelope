        There are controls here to change the size of the labels and the font,
        which require Javascript to work. You have Javascript disabled. Please
        enable Javascript to use these controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a print button here, which requires Javascript to work. If
        you are using Firefox, you can print without Javascript by right
        clicking on the envelope and selecting "This Frame" > "Print Frame". If
        you are using Chrome or other browsers based on it, right click on the
        envelope and select "Print", and in the print dialog make sure you have
        margins set to none.

      <h2>What is this website?</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a template for printing addresses on envelopes. It
        allows you to fill out the addresses and print them on an envelope. You
        will need a printer that can print on envelopes, loaded with #10
        envelopes. #10 is the most common size of envelope in the US. It might
        also work with envelopes of other sizes if you play around with the
        scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this template, click the sections on the envelope labeled "FROM"
        and "TO" and write the address you want to print. You can change the
        size of the labels and the font used. Then click on the "Print" button
        to print the envelope. Your browser's print dialog will open. Make sure
        to select the "Envelope #10" paper size, pick "Landscape" orientation,
        and turn off headers and footers.

      <h2>Why use this website?</h2>
      <p>
        I needed to print on some envelopes, and looking around online I found
        guides that told me to just use Microsoft Word. I don't have Microsoft
        Word though! So I started looking around online for a simple template
        like this, but I couldn't find anything. So I made this website. If you
        are in a similar situation, I hope this website helps you!
